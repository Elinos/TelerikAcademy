    <p>1. Write an expression that checks if given integer is odd or even.</p>
    <p>2. Write a boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be divided (without remainder) by 7 and 5 in the same time.</p>
    <p>3. Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area by given width and height.</p>
    <p>4. Write an expression that checks for given integer if its third digit (right-to-left) is 7. E. g. 1732  true.</p>
    <p>5. Write a boolean expression for finding if the bit 3 (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.</p>
    <p>6. Write an expression that checks if given print (x,  y) is within a circle K(O, 5).</p>
    <p>7. Write an expression that checks if given positive integer number n (n ≤ 100) is prime. E.g. 37 is prime.</p>
    <p>8. Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides a and b and height h.</p>
    <p>9. Write an expression that checks for given point (x, y) if it is within the circle K( (1,1), 3) and out of the rectangle R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2).</p>
